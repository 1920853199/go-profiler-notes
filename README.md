# go-profiler-notes

I've just started a new job at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) to work on [Continuous Profiling](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/code-profiling/) for Go. To make sure that I know what I'm talking about, I'm planning to do an in-depth study of the existing profilers and how they work. I'll try to summarize what I learned in this repository as it might be useful to others.

For now there is nothing worth looking at. Please come back later : )
